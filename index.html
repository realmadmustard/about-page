        <h2>I'm feelin' high during night rides through my hometown.</h2>
        <p>It's very interesting. Though, my city do not have any hillarious buildings or skyscrapers, but it makes great joy watching on people. Driving about 40 kph with loud music helps me to forget about every day problems. Bet you heard me, if not - you must. That's my main hobby nowadays - carmusic.</p>

        <h2>Earning skills</h2>
        <p>At the moment when I disassembled my computer in first time, I realized that it will be my number one interest of my life. Now I can easily assemble a personal computer, install all program features, and also make programs on my own. I can't say that I have some mad skills in development, but I really interested in it. Every day I watch YouTube (lol) videos containing some educational information. Today I can say that I can code on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.</p>
